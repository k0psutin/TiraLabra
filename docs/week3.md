# Week 3

## What I have done this week and program progression

I made a minimum heap for holding the nodes, increased the test coverage and started implementing IDA\*.

## What I have learned this week

That IDA\* is a mixture of BFS and DFS search with heuristic acting as a bound.

## What is unclear or has proven to be difficult?

I've done IDA\* according to the pseudo code. It runs well when there are no obstacles, but on a path with obstacles, it always timeouts.

## What should I do next

I should study why IDA\* isn't working properly when facing an obstacle. Perhaps I need a tiebreaker?
