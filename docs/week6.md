# Week 4

## What I have done this week and program progression

I've been updating the GUI to be more userfriendly.

## What is unclear or has proven to be difficult?

It is always difficult to assess whether the comments and the algorithms are good enough.

## What should I do next

I should finish the GUI and do a online research on how to turn my project into a .jar file.
