# Week 2

## What I have done this week and program progression

I have tried to implement A* and JPS algorithms.

## What I have learned this week

About different Heuristics and their use.

## What is unclear or has proven to be difficult?

I'm not sure if A* is actually really slow in 500x500 spaces or is my algorithm just running very slowly. If I disable backtracking, A\* will work at super speeds, but paths are not optimal. 
Maybe I should reduce the map sizes even further. Maybe the problem are tiebreakers?

## What should I do next

I'm creating tests to ensure Node class is working properly with PriorityQueue and try figure out why my A\* algorithm is slow, before moving into JPS and IDA\*.
