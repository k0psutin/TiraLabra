# Week 4

## What I have done this week and program progression

I've started writing the documents for the project.

## What is unclear or has proven to be difficult?

I decided to use visited table with IDA\* since it performs much faster (And i can compare it better with other algorithms), but the space complexity will be `O(V^2)`. I could get a better space complexity with HashSet, but I have to see if I have time to create HashSet. IDA\* space complexity when using tree graph is `O(d)`, but since I'm dealing with an acyclic graph, I don't think I can achieve that space complexity anyway.

## What should I do next

I should finish project structure documentation.
