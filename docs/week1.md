# Week 1

## What I have done this week and program progression

After deciding what my project will be, I've been getting familiar with Gradle (Java dependancy manager) and I created a walking skeleton of the project. There is no functionality besides a crude GUI where you can load an image.

## What I have learned this week

I've learned about Gradle and that JPS is an A\* optimization and that IDA\* is an variation of A\*.

## What is unclear or has proven to be difficult?

Time and space complexity of JPS is a bit unclear. I think it is portrayed the same as with A\*, but the node and depth amount is significantly less (since nodes being eliminated recursively).

## What should I do next

Next I will implement A\*, JPS and IDA\* algorithms using the standard Java data structures and try to utilize them for finding a path on an image.
